  # 42
This repository contains three projects developed as part of the 42 curriculum, focused on enhancing my skills in C programming and the development of fundamental libraries and functions.

## Projects

**1. Libft**

Description:
libft is a custom library in C that implements various standard functions from the C library, as well as some additional ones that I found useful. This project allowed me to reinforce my knowledge of memory management and string manipulation, creating a solid foundation for future projects.

Features:

- Implementation of string manipulation functions (like strdup, strjoin, etc.).
- Functions for memory management (malloc, free).
- Utilities like linked lists and conversion functions.

**2. Get Next Line**

Description:
get_next_line is a function that reads a complete line from a file descriptor, managing memory efficiently. This project challenged my understanding of input/output in C and buffer handling.

Features:

- Reading lines from files dynamically.
- Support for multiple file descriptors.
- Efficient memory management to prevent leaks.

**3. Printf**
   
Description:
The printf project consists of a basic recreation of the standard C printf function. This work allowed me to delve deeper into handling different format types and data conversions.

Features:

- Implementation of basic formats (such as %d, %s, %c).
- Handling of variable arguments.
- Customization and extensibility for future formats.
